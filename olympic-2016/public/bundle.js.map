className=\"intro\">\n          <p>台灣突破以往奧運參賽人數規模，共有58位運動員競逐18項賽事。除了大家熟知的戴資穎、盧彥勳、雷千瑩、蕭美玉、許淑淨、莊智淵、周天成等各界好手，還有36位首度參加奧運的體育新星，其中女子拳擊、女子角力、馬術都是台灣史上第一人，馬術選手汪亦岫更是首位贏得奧運馬術資格賽的華人。</p>\n          <p>預測誰會得獎很困難，即使實力再強的選手，也會有運氣不佳的時候。不過，把時間拉長，從體育資料下手，真的可以看出不同國家各自擅長的競技項目。</p>\n          <p>你知道奧運舉辦120年來，運動列強有哪些嗎？哪一國超級射手最多？誰搶了俄羅斯的體操王冕？誰又是桌球霸主？還有，台灣真的是跆拳道強國嗎？歷年奧運中，台灣得牌數是否在世界上佔有一席之地，還是只能在後面當小弟？更多問題，就讓《報導者》資料新聞團隊告訴你答案吧！</p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"item_line\" />\n
